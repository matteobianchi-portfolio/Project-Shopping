# Project-Shopping
I attended a 240-hours Data Science and AI Academy between March and April. This is my first script after completing the course.

# Python Version: 
This project uses 3.11 Python.

# Description:
This project deals with the opportunity of defining a model to learn when an online user session turns into a purchase.
Using a dataset provided from the open course CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python (https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/4/shopping/), I tried to define a script in which someone can handling the foremost machine learning models and techniques to take on the issues that the dataset shows (for example, the imbalance between the number of samples which turns in revenue (15%), and those which don't (85%)).
The goal is to get hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in a real-world-like scenario.
