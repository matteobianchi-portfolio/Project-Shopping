# Shopping Project
I attended a 240-hour Data Science and AI Academy between March and April. This is my first script after completing the course.

# Python Version: 
This project uses 3.11 Python.

# Description:
This project deals with the opportunity of defining a model to predict when an online user session will result in a purchase.
Using a dataset provided from the open course _CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python_ (https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/4/shopping/), I tried to define a script in which someone can handle the foremost machine learning models and techniques to take on the issues that the dataset presents (for example, the imbalance between the number of samples that results in revenue (15%), and those that don't (85%)).
The goal is to get hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in a real-world-like scenario.
